/**
Package <code>net.paulhertz.pixelaudio.curves</code> implements light weight classes 
for Bezier curve modeling. 
<p>
 Adapted from IgnoCodeLib Processing library for use with PixelAudio library.
 IgnoCodeLib is available in the Processing contributed libraries and at
 https://paulhertz.net/ignocodelib/ and https://github.com/Ignotus-mago/IgnoCodeLib3

<p>
<ul>
<li>PAVertex2DINF.java provides an interface for line and curve vertices.</li>
<li>PALineVertex.java stores a line vertex Interface for line and curve vertices</li>
<li>PABezVertex.java provides storage for a cubic Bezier curves's control points and anchor point.</li>
<li>PABezShape.java stores open or closed paths composed of lines and Bezier curves, and implements attributes and geometric transforms for them.</li>
<li>PACurveMaker.java is a utility and storage class for interactive drawing and curve modeling.</li>
<li>PACurveUtility.java provides static methods that support curve modeling and drawing.</li>
</ul>
