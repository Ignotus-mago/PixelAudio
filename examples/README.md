As of March 2, 2025, we have the following examples:

- **LookupTables**: an introduction to a core concept in PixelAudio, lookup tables. Start here. 
- **Starter**: basics of creating a PixelMapGen instance and plugging it into a PixelAudioMapper.
- **QuickAnimation**: a simple way to animate a bitmap using PixelAudioMapper.
- **TransformPimage**: introduces the affine transforms available in the BitmapTransform class.
- **SimpleWaveSynth**: basics of creating a WaveSynth animation. 
- **JSONWaveSynth**: read and write JSON data to configure a WaveSynth.
- **MultiGenDemo**: chain PixelMapGens together to generate a large image.
- **BuildFromPathGenDemo**: read and write data from a PixelMapGen in JSON format. 
- **BigWaveSynth** use a WaveSynth with a large bitmap mapped to a MultiGen. 
- **BigWaveSynthAudio** use a WaveSynth as an additive audio synthesizer.
- **WaveSynthEditor** use a GUI to load, edit, listen to, save and output WaveSynth data to video
- **WaveSynthSequencer** use WaveSynth as an audio synthesizer to play sequences of notes
- **LoadAudioToImage**: read an audio file, trancode it into an image and then play audio samples. 
- **LoadImageToAudio**: read, write, play, and mix channels of images and audio files. 
- **AriaDemoApp**: draw lines to trigger sound, connect to Max with UDP, auto-load files
- **ArgosyDemo**: create and animate pixel patterns using number and color arrays
- **ArgosyMixer**: create Argosy patterns with a GUI, play them as audio, export animations to video.
- **AudioCapture**: capture streaming or live audio and turn it into a bitmap.
- **GenerateAndSaveAudio** use a Wave Synth to generate audio and animation simultaneously.
