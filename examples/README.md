- **QuickAnimation**: a simple way to animate a bitmap using PixelAudioMapper.
- **TransformPimage**: introduces the affine transforms available in the BitmapTransform class.
- **MultiGenDemo**: chain PixelMapGens together to generate a large image.
- **BuildFromPathGenDemo**: read and write data from a PixelMapGen in JSON format. 
- **LoadAudioToImage**: read an audio file, trancode it into an image and then play audio samples. 
- **LoadImageToAudio**: read, write, play, and mix channels of images and audio files. 
- **AudioCapture**: capture streaming or live audio and turn it into a bitmap.
- **SimpleWaveSynth**: basics of creating a WaveSynth animation. 
- **JSONWaveSynth**: read and write JSON data to configure a WaveSynth.
- **BigWaveSynth** use a WaveSynth with a large bitmap mapped to a MultiGen. 
- **GenerateAndSaveAudio** use a Wave Synth to generate audio and animation simultaneously.
