As of May 31, 2025, we have these examples, in the suggested order for learning about PixelAudio:

- **LookupTables**: an introduction to a core concept in PixelAudio, lookup tables. Start here. 
- **Starter**: basics of creating a PixelMapGen instance and plugging it into a PixelAudioMapper.
- **QuickAnimation**: a simple way to animate a bitmap using PixelAudioMapper.
- **TransformPimage**: introduces the affine transforms available in the BitmapTransform class.
- **MultiGenDemo**: chain PixelMapGens together to generate a large image.
- **MultiGenLookupTables**: lookup tables in MultiGens, a useful place to test your MultiGenCode.
- **BuildFromPathGenDemo**: read and write data from a PixelMapGen in JSON format. 
- **SimpleWaveSynth**: basics of creating a WaveSynth animation. 
- **JSONWaveSynth**: read and write JSON data to configure a WaveSynth.
- **BigWaveSynth** use a WaveSynth with a large bitmap mapped to a MultiGen. 
- **BigWaveSynthAudio** use a WaveSynth as an additive audio synthesizer.
- **WaveSynthEditor** use a GUI to load, edit, listen to, save and output WaveSynth data to video
- **WaveSynthSequencer** use WaveSynth as an audio synthesizer to play sequences of notes
- **LoadAudioToImage**: read an audio file, trancode it into an image and then play audio samples. 
- **LoadImageToAudio**: read, write, play, and mix channels of images and audio files. 
- **ArgosyMixer**: create Argosy patterns with a GUI, play them as audio, export animations to video.
- **AudioCapture**: capture streaming or live audio and turn it into a bitmap.
- **AriaDemoApp**: draw lines to trigger sound, connect to Max with UDP, auto-load files

You can open library examples with the Processing File menu->Examples... command.
