// This sketch is a placeholder.
// Two tutorial sketches were combined for TutorialOne_02_FileIO:
// one handled file i/o and the other provided a first look at 
// generating audio events with the PixelAudio library.
// It makes more sense to combine them than to keep them separate,
// but for the moment I'm not renumbering the tutorial files.
